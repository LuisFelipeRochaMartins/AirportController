<h2>                         Airport Controller
</h2>
        That is a Project to simulate how an Airport Controller should work,
    following some rules: 
<ul>
        <li> If a Plane is almost out of fuel this Airplane should be <strong>prioritized</strong></li>
        <li> Every 30 minutes 0,1 or 2 <strong>Planes</strong> will arrive.</li>
        <li> Every 30 minutes 0,1 or 2 <strong>Planes</strong> took off.</li>
        <li> And if the airport does  not have space  to allocate theses Planes
    they will be redirected to the nearest Airport.</li>
</ul>
